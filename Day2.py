# API Architectural styles 
"""
1. REST : most populat api architecture for transferring data over the internet. 
In a restful context, resources are accessible via endpoints, and operations are performed on those resources
with standard  HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE

2. Soap : stands for simple object access protocol, uses XML to transfer highly structured messages between a client and server.

3. GraphQL : Open source query language that enables clients to interact with a single API endpoint to retrieve the excat data they need,
without chaining multiple requests together

4. webhooks : webhooks are used to implement event-driven architectures, in ehich requests are automatically sent in response to event-based tiggers.

5. gRPC : RPC stands for remote procedure call, and grpc apis were originated by google
